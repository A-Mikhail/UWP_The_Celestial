Unfinished Application for **Windows 10** written on **WinJS**. RIP :sweat_drops:

>> Purpose of the app was to combine popular cloud based storages. 
Where you can pick files and folders from your device to synchronize in the chosen cloud storages 
without creating copy of existence files in the clouds storage folders.

The app isn't finished and will never be finished, because mostly of my inexperience at that time
and what also important from incorrect picked tools of developing. WinJs at the moment of the developing
wasn't get update at all, many bugs wasn't fixed, and documentation for the framework as well wasn't
updated too.

Otherwise this was a good experience for me, even though without result at the end. Anyway if someone
read this and wanted to write application for **Windows Store** I encourage not doing it :exclamation: 

But if you still insist on it, than better take **C#** instead of JS-based tools for the developing, it has 
much more complete docs, examples and support of a communities.
